# Facebook+ #

*Facebook+* enables you to share your Google+ Posts to Facebook via the public
FB _sharer.php_ API.

Right now, it works like this:

* Post your comment on Google+
* Reload the page (this won't be necessary in future releases)
* Click on the _Menu_ Button to the right of your post
* There should be a menu item named *Post to Facebook*
* Click on it
* A popup _should_ open to share your post to Facebook

## Installation ##
For now, you will have to download the project here on GitHub, extract it, and
[load it as an unpacked extension](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html).

Once this is stable, the extension will be available from the _Google Chrome Extensions_ site.

## Known Bugs ##

### Important ###
